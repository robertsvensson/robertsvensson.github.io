      <div class="col col-xl-8" id="mainText">

        <p>I have well over ten years of experience in the security field. My hands-on know-how comes from working in large multi-national environments and networks taking care of security incidents and maintaining security systems such as proxy servers, firewalls and VPNs. I’ve also carried out numerous pen tests to make sure that systems and networks are compliant against the PCI-DSS standard.</p>
<p>I successfully ran my own security consulting company for a number of years. In one of my assignments, I worked for one of the world’s largest clothing retailers, H&amp;M, at their Security Operations Center. My responsibilities included digging through log files to analyze and sort out potential threats as well as fine-tuning Network Intrusion Prevention Systems and Vulnerability Management Solutions. My responsibilities also included on-call duty to quickly respond to global security incidents. The environment was fast-paced and in co-operation with a remote SOC team in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>My constant desire to participate in the security community lead me to create <a href="https://dasmalwerk.eu/" title="DasMalwerk.eu">DasMalwerk.eu</a> — a
web service dedicated to providing fresh malware samples to fellow security researchers in a safe way. As I believe that nothing beats having hands-on experience with malicious software once disaster strikes.</p>
<p>When it comes to operating systems I can get things done on anything from my Commodore 64 to Windows, Linux, macOS and in worst case even NT4 and Novell NetWare.</p>
<p>I also have a deep passion for the written word. In fact, I used that passion to write a book called <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hacking-Report-Writing-Introduction-Penetration/dp/1484222822">From hacking to report writing — an introduction to security and penetration testing</a>. Released in late 2016 by Apress, the book has helped many aspiring penetration testers to turn IT-security into a career. </p>
